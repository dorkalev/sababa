SABABA - a way too simple to translate your buttons and short-texts

SABABA allows you to manage a key-value translation dictionary of different languages for your multi-lingual site needs

> if you need to have a button/title in a different language according to user's lang...

WHAT IT DOES?

you run "ruby sababa.rb" -> it takes dictionaries/*.txt files (the key-value dictionary) and jsons them into dictionary.js

THATS WHERE RUBY USAGE ENDS <<

on the client side's HTML HEAD tag you include:

  <script src="/dictionary.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"></script>
  <script>
    var current_language = "italian";  
  </script>

you manage current_language variable according to user's langauge

and where translated text is needed you use the amazing <dictkey> tag:

    <dictkey>hello</dictkey>

or 'dictkeyatt' attribute that indicates which attribute of the element contains a value that should be translated:
 
    <input type="submit" value="submit" dictkeyatt="value" />

you will see that:
    <dictkey>hello</dictkey>  CHANGES TO  <dictkey>ciao</dictkey>
    
and
    <input type="submit" value="submit" dictkeyatt="value" />  CHANGES TO  <input type="submit" value="vai" dictkeyatt="value" />

DEMO

you can run a simple demo app:

  ruby demo.rb

EPILOGUE

As always, I am more interested in showing a proof of concept rather than creating a super-does-it-all tool
I hope you like the concept and will find it useful.
